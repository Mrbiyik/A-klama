# README

# For backend Spring Tool Suite 4 was used
  Download link is https://spring.io/tools
  Downloading is not necessary.(In my opinion)
  Backend is a spring boot project.
  Dao pattern was used.
  It has Controller-Service-Dao layers
  Also for security management, security layer was added.
    -It manages sessions.(JWT for session management was coded by me.)
    -It filters inputs
  **Before running the machine just control the application.properities for JDBC connection. Please make sure it fits with your
    database information
    
# For frontend Netbeans IDE was used
  You can download it. But it is not necessary.
  Also you need server like Apache2 for front end.
  You can download XAMP server for apache and mysql.
  Just pull all these files to the apache2 var/www/html file for XAMP C:\xamp\htdocs\huaweiapp\{files} -->(create huaweiapp)
  Also if you are in environment which has restrictions(firewall, proxy vb.) you should change it. Because frontend uses
  bootstrap 4, jquery, fontawsome libraries.(I think it will not be a problem)
    
# For database xamp server was used

  You can get .sql file and just import it in from phpmyadmin page
  or you can see the queries and information inside it, so you can create them with SQL language.
  
# In lab environment:
  
  Frontend: localhost:80
  Backend: localhost:8080
  Mysql: localhost:3306
